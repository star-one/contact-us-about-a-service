# contact-us-about-a-service
A &lt;select&gt; form element / dropdown JavaScript and HTML navigation widget to direct users to the correct specific form on a contact us page

As seen on https://www.birmingham.gov.uk/info/50044/contact_us_form

In the context it was created for, it's a navigation widget which when a user comes to a general contact us form lets them select what they're wanting to contact us about, and tries to steer them towards the appropriate form or page to actually most efficiently (for them and for us) instigate the correct kind of contact rather than completing a generic contact us form.

Obviously you could use it for any kind of navigation or content reveal, not just on a contact page!

I'm conscious this sort of JavaScript is probably considered a bit oldskool by modern standards - but it's small, neat, and fast, which is the important thing.

I'm also conscious that whilst I have a general understanding of accessibility, I'm not an accessibility *specialist*, so I can't personally vouch for it in that regard. But what I can say is it's been subject to a number of accessibility audits by people who *are* accessibility specialists over the years, and nobody has yet highlighted a problem with it to me. You could be the first!
